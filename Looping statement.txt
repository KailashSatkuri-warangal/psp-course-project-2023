Looping statement
Looping statement is a statement that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.
There are three types of looping statements: for loop, while loop, and do-while loop.                                  
 For loop:                                  
          for (initialization; condition; increment)
	 {                                   
          // block of code to be executed repeatedly                                  
          }                                  
While loop:                                  
          while (condition)
	 {                                   
          // block of code to be executed repeatedly                                  
          }                                  
Do-while loop:                                  
          do
	 {                                   
          // block of code to be executed repeatedly                                  
          } while (condition);                                  
Example problem:                                  
          Write a program to print the numbers from 1 to 10.                                  
Solution:                                  
          int i;                                   
          for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
		 {                                   
           printf("%d", i);                                   
          }
